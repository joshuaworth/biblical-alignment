# 📖 Biblical Alignment — Foundational Principles

> *This document defines the theological and epistemological foundations of this project. These are not opinions — they are derived directly from Scripture.* 📜✝️

🌐 **biblicalalignment.org**

---

## 1️⃣ Scripture as Final Authority 👑📖

**Principle**: The Bible is the final court of appeal for all matters of faith and practice.

**Basis**:
> *"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness"* — 2 Timothy 3:16 📖✨

> *The Bereans "examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true"* — Acts 17:11 🔍📜

**Implication**: No tradition, council, pope, pastor, or AI can override what Scripture plainly teaches. ❌🏛️ ✅📖

---

## 2️⃣ One Mediator ✝️🙏

**Principle**: Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity.

**Basis**:
> *"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus"* — 1 Timothy 2:5 ✝️

**Implication**:
- ✅ Prayer is addressed to God through Christ
- ❌ No saints, Mary, angels, or other beings are to be invoked as spiritual intermediaries

---

## 3️⃣ Tradition Must Bow to Scripture 🚫📜 → 📖👑

**Principle**: Human traditions are valid only when they do not contradict or nullify God's Word.

**Basis**:
> *"You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions."* — Mark 7:8 🚫

> *"Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down."* — Mark 7:13 ⚠️

**Implication**: Any practice, however ancient or widespread, that contradicts Scripture is rejected. Age, size, and institutional continuity do not validate a practice. 🏛️❌

---

## 4️⃣ Popularity ≠ Truth 📊🚫✅

**Principle**: The number of people who believe something is irrelevant to whether it is true.

**Basis**:
> *"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."* — Matthew 7:13-14 🚪🛤️

**Implication**:
- 📊 "50% of Christians are Catholic" proves nothing about Catholic doctrine
- 📊 "Only 3% are Reformed" proves nothing about Reformed doctrine
- 📊 Majority consensus is sociological data, not epistemic proof
- 🎯 **The text is the test — not the crowd**

---

## 5️⃣ Test Everything Against the Text 🔍📖

**Principle**: Every teaching, practice, and claim must be evaluated against Scripture.

**Basis**:
> *"Test everything; hold fast what is good."* — 1 Thessalonians 5:21 ✅🔬

> *The Berean model: receive the message, then "examine the Scriptures"* — Acts 17:11 📖🔍

**Implication**: This app exists to help users test claims against the text, not to tell them what to believe. 🧭📖

---

## 6️⃣ No Denominational Allegiance 🏛️🚫

**Principle**: This project does not align with or promote any specific denomination.

**Rationale**:
- 🏛️ Denominations are human organizational structures
- ⚖️ Some denominations contain more truth than others, but none are infallible
- 📖 The user should align with Scripture, not with a label

**Implication**:
- ❌ We don't say "Reformed is best"
- ❌ We don't say "Baptist is correct"
- ✅ We say: **"Here's what the text says. You decide."** 📖🧠

---

## 7️⃣ AI as Tool, Not Teacher 🤖🔧

**Principle**: AI assists study; it does not replace the Holy Spirit or personal discernment.

**Basis**:
> *"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things"* — John 14:26 🕊️

**Implication**:
- ✅ AI can find cross-references, explain Greek/Hebrew, and surface patterns
- ❌ AI cannot tell you what to believe
- ❌ AI must never contradict Scripture or lead users away from the text

## 🚪 Summary: The Gate System

Every feature passes through these gates before shipping:

| Gate | Question | Fail Condition |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 🅰️ | Does this honor Scripture as final authority? | Elevates tradition, feelings, or AI above text |
| 🅱️ | Does this keep Christ as sole mediator? | Introduces other intercessors |
| 🅲 | Does this avoid nullifying God's Word? | Creates loopholes or overrides |
| 🅳 | Does this avoid popularity-as-proof? | Uses size/age as evidence of truth |
| 🅴 | Does this help users test against the text? | Tells users what to believe instead of showing the text |

🚫 **If a feature fails any gate, it does not ship.** 🚫
