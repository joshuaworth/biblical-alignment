**THE BEREAN STANDARD BIBLE**
We use the Berean Standard Bible (BSB), a modern, accurate translation in the public domain. Like the Bereans in Acts 17:11, we encourage you to examine the Scriptures for yourself.

**OUR PRINCIPLES**
1. Scripture is final authority (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
2. Christ alone is mediator (1 Timothy 2:5)
3. No tradition overrides Scripture (Mark 7:8-13)
4. Popularity doesn't equal truth (Matthew 7:13-14)
5. We help you test, not tell you what to believe (Acts 17:11)
