📜 THE BEREAN STANDARD BIBLE
We use the Berean Standard Bible (BSB), a modern, accurate translation in the public domain. Like the Bereans in Acts 17:11, we encourage you to examine the Scriptures for yourself.

⛪ OUR PRINCIPLES
1. Scripture is final authority (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
2. Christ alone is mediator (1 Timothy 2:5)
3. No tradition overrides Scripture (Mark 7:8-13)
4. Popularity doesn't equal truth (Matthew 7:13-14)
5. We help you test, not tell you what to believe (Acts 17:11)

🙏 WHY ANOTHER BIBLE APP?
Most Bible apps are cluttered with ads, push subscriptions, or promote specific denominations. Biblical Alignment is different. We believe God's Word should be freely accessible to everyone, presented beautifully, without agenda.

"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path." — Psalm 119:105
